# Netflix Clone

## Project Overview
Netflix Clone is a web application designed to mimic the functionalities of the popular streaming service, Netflix. The primary goal of this project is to create an aesthetically pleasing and responsive interface that allows users to navigate and interact with a simulated movie-streaming platform.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-clone.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd netflix-clone
   ```
3. **Open the index.html file in your web browser:**
   Simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it through your browser's menu.

## Usage
Once you have the application open in your browser, you can interact with the user interface. The hero section displays a call-to-action with a button to get started. Clicking the button will direct you to a Google Form, which is presumably for user registration or feedback.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Call-to-Action:** A prominent button encourages user engagement to start using the service.
- **Stylish Header:** The navigation bar includes a logo, enhancing brand presence.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following resources:
- **Google Fonts:** For the `Roboto` font to ensure a modern typography style.
- **Custom CSS and JavaScript Files:** It includes external CSS (css/style_v2.css) for styling and a JavaScript file (js/script.js) for additional functionality.
